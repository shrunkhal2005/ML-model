This project, developed by **Group 16** for the *Machine Learning Lab (V-A)*, focuses on predicting lifestyle-related disease risks using **machine learning techniques**. It analyzes various health and lifestyle factors such as **age, sleep duration, diet, stress level, and BMI** to determine whether a person is at risk or healthy. The model was built using **Python** and **scikit-learn**, with the **Random Forest** algorithm achieving the best accuracy.  

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future predictions. It serves as an academic project demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in **health analysis**.
